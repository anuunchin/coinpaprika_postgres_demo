# "Loading Nested Data from an API into a PostgreSQL Database with dlt"


## Overview

This demo project demonstrates how to load nested data from three separate API endpoints, where two of the endpoints rely on the third. It demonstrates how to set up `dlt` (Data Loading Tool) resources, including transformer resources and a source that merges them into a single dataset. Additionally, it includes a pipeline that handles the data ingestion process. PostgreSQL is used as the storage destination, and data is sourced from the Coinpaprika API.
